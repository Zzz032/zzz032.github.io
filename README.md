## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. A resume formatted in Markdown, similar to the provided example.
2. A GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com/join).
3. Familiarity with Markdown. If new to Markdown, review this [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

**Relating to Etter's Principles**: Utilize lightweight tools and distributed version control systems, as Etter recommends.

1. Sign into GitHub and click the '+' icon at the top right to select 'New Repository'.
2. Name your repository `username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your GitHub username.
3. Set the repository to Public and initialize it with a README.

### 2. Add Your Resume to the Repository

1. Clone your new repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Add your Markdown-formatted resume (`index.md`) to the repository.
3. Commit and push the changes back to GitHub.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository settings, find the "Pages" section.
2. Select your main branch as the source.
3. Save, and your resume is now live at `https://username.github.io`.

*Note: Replace `username` with your GitHub username.*

### Animated Demo

*Include an animated GIF demonstrating the upload of `index.md` and the activation of GitHub Pages.*

## FAQs

**Why use Markdown for a resume?**
Markdown is preferred for its simplicity, portability, and version control friendlinessâ€”key advantages highlighted by Etter for technical documents.

**Why isn't my resume appearing on GitHub Pages?**
Ensure the repository is named correctly (`username.github.io`), and GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings. It may take a few minutes for changes to go live.
