## Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

**Relating to Etter's Principles**: Utilize lightweight tools and distributed version control systems, as Etter recommends.

1. Sign into GitHub and click the '+' icon at the top right to select 'New Repository'.

### 2. Add Resume to the Repository

1. Clone my new repository to my local machine using Git.

2. Add my Markdown-formatted resume (`index.md`) to the repository.
3. Commit and push the changes back to GitHub.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. In my repository settings, find the "Pages" section.
2. Select my main branch as the source.
3. Save, and my resume is now live at `https://username.github.io`.

4. and try to run the github page website 




## Technical writing

### Use Plain Language

**Before**: "Utilize lightweight tools and distributed version control systems, as Etter recommends."

**After**: "Use simple tools and share the work online with tools like GitHub, as suggested by Andrew Etter."

### Write for the Web

- **Organize the content** into short, digestible sections.
- **Use bullet points** for lists, like in my "Prerequisites" section, to keep information clear and easy to scan.

### Use a Minimalist Approach

**Before**: "Sign into GitHub and click the '+' icon at the top right to select 'New Repository'."

**After**: "Sign into GitHub, click '+', and choose 'New Repository'."

### Use a Structured Approach

- **Break down instructions** into numbered steps to guide readers through the process in an organized manner.
- **Clearly label sections** like "Instructions," "More Resources," and "FAQs" to help readers navigate to the information they need.

### Use a Version Control System

- Mention the **importance of using GitHub** for version control in the instructions, highlighting how it helps keep the resume updated.

### Write in Markdown

- Emphasize the **benefits of Markdown** for creating resume, noting its simplicity and versatility.

### Use Screenshots and Diagrams

- Include **screenshots** or **animated GIFs** to visually guide users through the steps, such as creating a repository, adding a resume file, and enabling GitHub Pages.


Applying these principles, README becomes more accessible, user-friendly, and effective in conveying the necessary steps to host and format a resume on GitHub Pages. Here's how a section could be improved:

**Before**: 
"Clone my new repository to my local machine using Git. Add my Markdown-formatted resume (`index.md`) to the repository. Commit and push the changes back to GitHub."

**After**: 
"1. **Clone repository**: Use Git to copy my repository to my computer. 
1. **Add the resume**: Put `index.md` resume file in the repository.
2. **Update GitHub**: Save the changes and upload them back to GitHub."

## FAQs

**Why use Markdown for a resume?**
Markdown is preferred for its simplicity, portability, and version control friendlinessâ€”key advantages highlighted by Etter for technical documents.

**Why isn't my resume appearing on GitHub Pages?**
Ensure the repository is named correctly (`username.github.io`), and GitHub Pages is enabled in my repository settings. It may take a few minutes for changes to go live.
