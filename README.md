## Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

**Relating to Etter's Principles**: Utilize lightweight tools and distributed version control systems, as Etter recommends.

1. Sign into GitHub and click the '+' icon at the top right to select 'New Repository'.
2. Name my repository `username.github.io`, replacing `username` with my GitHub username.
3. Set the repository to Public and initialize it with a README.


### 2. Add Resume to the Repository

1. Clone my new repository to my local machine using Git.
2. Add my Markdown-formatted resume (`index.md`) to the repository.
3. Commit and push the changes back to GitHub.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. In my repository settings, find the "Pages" section.
2. Select my main branch as the source.
3. Save, and my resume is now live at `https://username.github.io`.


## Jekyll

1. go to [website](https://pages.github.com/themes/) choose one theme
   
2. in the theme there will be a usage of this theme
   
3. copy this usage to the `_config.yml` file
   
4. and try to run your github page website

## FAQs

**Why use Markdown for a resume?**
Markdown is preferred for its simplicity, portability, and version control friendlinessâ€”key advantages highlighted by Etter for technical documents.

**Why isn't my resume appearing on GitHub Pages?**
Ensure the repository is named correctly (`username.github.io`), and GitHub Pages is enabled in my repository settings. It may take a few minutes for changes to go live.
